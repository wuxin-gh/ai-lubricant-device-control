/**
 * Thread-safe implementation of [AccessibilityNodeCache] using [AtomicReference].
 *
 * Uses atomic swap for lock-free cache replacement:
 * - [populate]: atomically swaps in a defensive copy of the provided map. Old entries are
 *   NOT recycled because a concurrent [get] call may still hold a reference to a [CachedNode]
 *   from the old map. Since `AccessibilityNodeInfo.recycle()` is a no-op on API 33+ (minSdk),
 *   GC safely collects unreferenced old entries.
 * - [get]: reads the current map (no locking).
 * - [clear]: atomically swaps to an empty map AND recycles old entries. Recycling is
 *   safe even with concurrent [get] callers because `AccessibilityNodeInfo.recycle()` is
 *   a no-op on API 33+ (minSdk). Called on service shutdown and after a settled window
 *   transition (soft-keyboard show/hide, rotation, activity/dialog change); an in-flight node
 *   action keeps using the reference it already resolved, so concurrency with [get] is safe
 *   regardless of timing.
