/**
 * Debounces cache-invalidation requests triggered by accessibility window-structure changes
 * (soft-keyboard show/hide, screen rotation, activity/dialog transitions).
 *
 * During such a transition the framework emits a BURST of events (window added, bounds settled,
 * content reflowed, ...). Invalidating on every event would thrash the node cache and could clear
 * it mid-animation while layout bounds are still moving. Instead, each [schedule] call (re)starts
 * a single timer and [onSettled] runs only once the event stream has been QUIET for
 * [debounceMillis] — i.e. AFTER the visual change has finished. This is the core guarantee:
 * exactly one invalidation per settled transition, never one mid-transition.
 *
 * Thread-safety: [schedule] and [cancel] are mutually synchronized, so the class is correct even
 * if invoked off the main thread, although in production accessibility callbacks are delivered on
 * the main thread.
 *
 * @param scope coroutine scope that owns the debounce timer (the accessibility service scope in
 *   production). Cancelling this scope cancels any pending invalidation.
 * @param debounceMillis quiet period that must elapse after the most recent [schedule] before
 *   [onSettled] runs.
 * @param onSettled invoked once per settled transition, on [scope]'s dispatcher. SHOULD be
 *   lightweight and non-blocking. Any exception it throws is caught and logged so it can never
 *   crash the dispatcher thread.
