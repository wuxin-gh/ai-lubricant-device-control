/**
 * Collapses Chromium WebView accessibility subtrees into a far smaller tree WITHOUT losing any
 * text content or any interactive (tap) target.
 *
 * WebViews expose one accessibility node per DOM element, which explodes the node count on
 * content-heavy pages (a single article list can be thousands of nodes). Chrome and the Android
 * System WebView populate [AccessibilityNodeData.webRole] (the Chromium DOM role) on every web
 * node, which lets us scope this collapsing strictly to web content — native and Compose subtrees
 * (where `webRole` is null) are returned untouched, by reference.
 *
 * ## Algorithm (single bottom-up pass = fixpoint)
 *
 * Within a web subtree, each node is classified and processed after its children:
 * - **Anchor** — an interactive node (clickable / long-clickable / editable / scrollable). Always
 *   kept (it is a tap target). Its text becomes its accessible name plus any descendant content
 *   not already present in that name. Keeps its original id and bounds, so element actions still
 *   resolve it.
 * - **Block** — a semantic block role ([BLOCK_ROLES]: article, listItem, section, figure, …).
 *   Kept when it carries any content, holding the merged markdown of its non-block descendants.
 *   Empty blocks are dropped and their kept descendants bubble up.
 * - **Plain** — everything else (staticText, heading, image, paragraph, genericContainer, …). The
 *   node itself is removed; its content bubbles up (as markdown) into the nearest kept ancestor and
 *   its kept descendants are re-parented to that ancestor.
 *
 * ## Markdown annotation
 *
 * Non-interactive content is annotated with minimal markdown so structure survives the collapse:
 * `# ` for headings, `- ` for list items, `![alt](url)` for images, `[text](url)` for links. This
 * is intentionally NOT a full HTML→Markdown conversion.
 *
 * ## Invariants (verified by tests)
 * - **No text is ever dropped**: every text/contentDescription token (and every image URL) present
 *   in the input survives somewhere in the output.
 * - **No two interactive nodes are merged together**: every tap target keeps its own node.
 * - Native / Compose subtrees are returned unchanged (same instances).
 *
 * This runs only on the screen-state output. The node cache used by element/action commands is
 * populated separately from the original (un-merged) tree, and merged anchors keep their original
 * ids, so taps and look-ups are unaffected.
 *
 * Vendored from ARC-MCP (MIT, see NOTICE); only the package and the MCP-specific wording changed.
