/**
 * Abstraction over AccessibilityInputConnection operations for natural text input.
 * Wraps the InputMethod API (API 33+) provided by the AccessibilityService
 * with FLAG_INPUT_METHOD_EDITOR.
 *
 * Implementations access the real AccessibilityInputConnection via
 * the accessibility service's InputMethod instance.
 *
 * **Threading**: The AccessibilityInputConnection obtained from InputMethod is an
 * IPC proxy managed by the accessibility framework — it is NOT a View-bound
 * InputConnection. Methods can be called from any thread safely.
 * If runtime testing reveals thread-safety issues, the interface methods would
 * need to be changed to `suspend` to enable `withContext(Dispatchers.Main)`.
 *
 * **Concurrency**: The caller must serialize mutating operations so concurrent
 * requests cannot interleave character commits. In device-control that is the
 * protocol-level rule that mutating commands are serialized per device
 * (`spec/protocol-v0.md` §5).
 *
 * **Return values**: The underlying `AccessibilityInputConnection` mutating methods
 * (`commitText`, `setSelection`, `performContextMenuAction`, `sendKeyEvent`,
 * `deleteSurroundingText`) return `void` in the Android framework. The `Boolean`
 * return on this interface indicates IC **availability** (true = IC was non-null
 * and the call was dispatched), NOT whether the target field accepted the
 * operation. Silent rejection by the target app (e.g., input filters, maxLength)
 * is undetectable via this interface.
